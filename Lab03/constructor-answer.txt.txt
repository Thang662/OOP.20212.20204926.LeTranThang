If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to
build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
The answer is no because although JAVA can have overloading method but category and title have the 
same type which is String so that if we make another constructor to build a DVD by category the 
program can't define if we want to create a DVD by title or by category.
